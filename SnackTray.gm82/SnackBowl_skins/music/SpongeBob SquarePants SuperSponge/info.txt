SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS: SUPERSPONGE (Music mod for Boll Deluxe)

Music composed by: Matthew Simmonds
Music ripped by: nickham13 (SuperSponge)
				 Knurek (?) (Nicktoons Unite! DS)
Some sounds taken from The Sounds Resource
Music pack made by... me! (CyanideJam)

I made this music pack in a few days, I don't know if this is that well made, but I genuinely really enjoy the music from both these games, and I had the thought of a music pack of this for a while now, so I tried my best.
This will be updated alongside Boll, as I still have a bunch of music to add for future levels and such.

Also I'm incredibly bored LMAO
If you're reading this then you're cool I think

K bye
