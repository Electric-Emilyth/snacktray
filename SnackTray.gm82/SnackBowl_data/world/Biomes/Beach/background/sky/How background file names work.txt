In order to make a value negative, dont use "-" do it like this instead "m125" so parallax_x_m10 as an example.


Depth_[]=depth
Transparent= Tag that makes the background transparent, the last 8 lines are removed from the file height to assure there's space to allow for game maker to grab the correct transparency.

Parallax_X_[]= Parallax (X axis)   can go from -100 to 100, serves as a percentage of how much the camera's movements affects the parallax. 
Thus, at 100 parallax, the background will move 1 to 1 with where the view is at. and if 0, the background will not move at all. (This is the default value.)

Noloop_X= Tag that makes it so that this specific part only renders once and never loops.
Clamp_X= Tag that makes it so that this specific image will never be offscreen.

Offset_X_[]= Offset (X Axis) this moves the background to be offset to any value, very useful for noloop_x.
Regionedge_X[]= (X Axis), can go from 0-100, this percentage will autoamtically offset the x position of the background depending on the current region's size. Only really useful if the noloop_x tag is present. 

Scroll_X_[]= Scroll (X Axis) how many pixels to the left this background will move per frame.

Animated_X_[]= how many animated frames are present on the horizontal axis.

Designed_Region_X_[]= The Region Width this background elemnt is designed for. When applied, this background piece will adapt to whatever region size really is, makign sure it's movements are equal to how they would be on the specified region size.


Parallax_Y_[]= Parallax (Y axis)   can go from -100 to 100, serves as a percentage of how much the camera's movements affects the parallax. 
Thus, at 100 parallax, the background will move 1 to 1 with where the view is at. and if 0, the background will not move at all. (This is the default value.)

Noloop_Y= Tag that makes it so that this specific part only renders once and never loops.
Clamp_Y= Tag that makes it so that this specific image will never be offscreen.

Offset_Y_[]= Offset (Y Axis) this moves the background to be offset to any value, very useful for noloop_y.
Regionedge_Y[]= (Y Axis), can go from 0-100, this percentage will autoamtically offset the x position of the background depending on the current region's size. Only really useful if the noloop_y tag is present. 

Scroll_Y_[]= Scroll (Y Axis) how many pixels to the left this background will move per frame.

Animated_Y_[]= how many animated frames are present on the horizontal axis.

Designed_Region_Y_[]= The Region Height this background elemnt is designed for. When applied, this background piece will adapt to whatever region size really is, makign sure it's movements are equal to how they would be on the specified region size.
